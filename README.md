Assignment for CIS 700 - Interactive Fiction and Text Generation

## You themed text adventure game

I made a You themed game, since I recently watched the Netflix show You and really enjoyed it. The protagonist of the game is a person (of any gender) who is stalked by Joe, the main character of the show. The locations are a grocery store called Anavrin, home, the bookstore Joe works at, his home, the bookstore's basement, and the glass cage he keeps his victims in.
